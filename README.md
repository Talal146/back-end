### **_Future Updates_**

1)	Integration with an AI chatbot to recommend workout plans and diet recommendations

2)	The ability to connect with gyms to that your workout plan is synced to their system and any trainer can train you with that gym plan rather than only one trainer and gym.

3)	A meal plan service that will allow the user to connect with grocery stores to order what they will need to make those meals.
